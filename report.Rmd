## Aim

To look at the geographic impact of Government funded services on deprivation.

Ideally, we wanted to look at whether having multiple different services in an area was better than just a single service



## Data

 - Unit of analysis: Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs)
   - Small areas set to have population 1000-3000
   - 32,844	in England
   - Highly local effects which might not be seen at a local authority level
 - Response variable: Income deprivation (define this)
   - Available at LSOA level for 2010, 2015 and 2019
   - Likely to respond to the kind of services we are considering 
   
## Data
   
 - Primary regressors: Location of publically funded services
   - Jobcenters (for period 2010-2019)
   - GP practices (current snapshot)
   - Legal aid offices (housing & debt providers, for period 2010-2019)
 - Controls: Other geographic features

## How much of the reduction in income deprivation is due to public services?

Can we use OLS?


$$
\Delta d = \alpha + \sum ( \beta_i \times p_i) + controls +\epsilon_j
$$

where:

 - $\Delta d$ is the change in income deprivation percentage
 - $\beta_i$ and $p_i$ are the coefficients and dummy variables for proximity to publicly funded service $i$
 - $\epsilon_j$ is the error term

## Can we estimate impact using panel regression?

Need equation

Controls for fixed effects

We show first first difference and fixed effects

BUT

 - GPs are everywhere, and we did not have data over time
 - Jobcentres similarly do not move, excepting the small number of closures in 2018
 - Leaves only Legal Aid offices

Within 2 miles of legal aid office

 More than 4 miles from legal aid office

## Can we estimate impact using panel regression?

London

## Can we estimate impact using panel regression?

Outside London

(Other sub-regions lack any statistical significance)

## Conclusion

There remains some methodological issues:

 - lead/lag time
 - crow-flies distance - not always realistic proxy for accessibility
 - more time periods would be better (also could try DiD)

Seems likely that lacking access to justice is a factor which can increase deprivation

<div class="notes">
It presumably takes time for an office to have an impact in an area, but we haven't accounted for this
