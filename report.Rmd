## Aim

To look at the geographic impact of Government funded services on deprivation.

Ideally, we wanted to look at whether having multiple different services in an area was better than just a single service

> income and skills

agglomeration

rich people concentrate

## Data

 - Unit of analysis: Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs)
   - Small areas set to have population 1000-3000
   - 32,844	in England
   - Highly local effects which might not be seen at a local authority level
 - Response variable: Income deprivation
   - Available at LSOA level for 2010, 2015 and 2019
   - Likely to respond to the kind of services we are considering 
   
## Data
   
 - Primary regressors: Location of publically funded services
   - Jobcenters (for period 2010-2019)
   - GP practices (current snapshot)
   - Legal aid offices (for period 2010-2019)
 - Controls: Other geographic features

## Correlations

Using OLS

Define a refression equation

$$
d = x + y +\epsilon
$$

where $x$ is something etc.

Show how we are implementing controls

## OLS results

start with a big null result

then add controls

## Estimating impact using panel regression


## Other approaches
